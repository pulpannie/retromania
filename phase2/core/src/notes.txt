PHASE 2 :
# Step 1

Code affected: RetroManiaGame.create, android/java/AndroidLauncher,
desktop/com.retromania.game.desktop/DesktopLauncher

Flaw : The code was instantiating a new screen, so we tried to use setScreen to set the screen
outside the class, but we couldn't do that because setScreen should be called after
"create" method is called.
Fix: so we used anonymous class and dependency injection in the backend
(pc and android implementation) to set the screen, because of this the RetroManiaGame,
which is one of our highest abstractions in our application,
is no longer dependant on the screen classes.


# Step 2

Code affected: RetroManiaGame.create, android/assets,
desktop/assets

Flaw : All the assets where in one folder and the management of the said folder was getting out of
hand.
Fix: Directories with the name of the projects where added to each asset folder, and a description
file was added to each folder for the description of the assets.
