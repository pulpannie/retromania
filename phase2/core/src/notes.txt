PHASE 2 :
# Step 1

Code affected: RetroManiaGame.create, android/java/AndroidLauncher,
desktop/com.retromania.game.desktop/DesktopLauncher

Flaw : The code was instantiating a new screen, so we tried to use setScreen to set the screen
outside the class, but we couldn't do that because setScreen should be called after
"create" method is called.
Fix: so we used anonymous class and dependency injection in the backend
(pc and android implementation) to set the screen, because of this the RetroManiaGame,
which is one of our highest abstractions in our application,
is no longer dependant on the screen classes.
