3 Different ways to render :
Ghost Mode : In this mode, you won't see your player but it can still get rewards and die or finish the game.
Normal Mode : You play the game like it's a normal mario game.

up with the game cam or you'll loose easily.


2 Different levels.



Each time you hit a question box you will get a reward, but the box will stay but you can pass through it,
this was done, so that you may think you still need to hit it with your head.

You're rewards will accumulate over different games and runs.


Bonus Hidden Secret : You will never die if you play in our menu screen, but you still will get rewards
so you can technically play the game to get infinite points.
