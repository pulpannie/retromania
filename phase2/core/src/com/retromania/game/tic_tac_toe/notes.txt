PHASE 2:

#Step 1
Code Affected: Cell, CellManager, TicTacToeLogic, TicTacToeStarter
Flaw: Code Smelled from Change Preventers.
TicTacToeStarter creates board and manages all Cell instances.
Fix: CellManager class created to manage Cell instances.
Delegated row, column, diagonal win checking methods from TicTacToeLogic to CellManager.
Removed Texture instance dependencies in Cell objects. Added converting method, .getCell() in TicTacToeStarter.

#Step 2
Code Affected: TicTacToeLogic
Flaw: nowinner variable in TicTacToeLogic class does not change value to reflect existence of winners.
Fix: added else if statement to isEnd() method in the class to check for no wins, and change the value accordingly.

#Step 3
Code Affected: TicTacToeStarter, TicTacToe
Flaw: TicTacToeStarter also implements TicTacToe interface. Should only implement the UI. Need to separate concern.
Fix: Create TicTacToe class that is responsible for the implementation of the game.

#Step 4
Code Affected: Cell, CellManager
Flaw: CellManager class has a logical flaw in calculating whether there is a win pattern.
Fix: Fixed the logic by removing for loops, readjusting indices. While trying to fix this Cell class was also modified.

#Step 5
Code Affected: TicTacToe, TicTacToeLogic, TicTacToeStarter
Flaw: TicTacToeLogic is a dispensible class. Function clashes with TicTacToe class.
Fix: By removing TicTacToeLogic, moving methods into TicTacToe. Also cleaned up TicTacToe code.

#Step 6
Code Affected: Cell, CellManager, TicTacToe, TicTacToeStarter
Flaw: TicTacToeStarter calls upon CellManager directly. Any calls should be made through TicTacToe.
      Similarly, TicTacToeStarter has a too complex UI Drawing system, Cell states should have unified information.
Fix: Added .getCellStates() method to TicTacToe class in order to pass double array of the state of Cells from TicTacToe class.
     Edited Cell and CellManager to simplify Cell state information.

#Step 7
Code Affected: TicTacToeStarter, GameLister
Flaw: Depreciated constructor
Fix: Fixed both classes to update to new constructor.

#Step 8
Code Affected: MenuScreen, PlayScreen, TicTacToeStarter
Flaw: TicTacToeStarter class implements whole TicTacToe game, when it should just start the game.
Fix: Separated TicTacToeStarter class to just start game, set screen to MenuScreen, then upon clicking a button users play.

#Step 9
Code Affected: All files inside tic_tac_toe package
Flaw: All files inside tic_tac_toe package are not organized into packages
Fix: Moved Cell, CellManager, TicTacToe class into newly created individuals package. Moved GameOverScreen, MenuScreen, PlayScreen into screens package.
