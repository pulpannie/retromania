COLOUR SHOOTER


GOAL OF THE GAME
__________________
The objective of the game is to shoot the bullet in the corresponding section (colour) of the Square
based on the textual description of the colour (i.e name of the colour). The tricky component is that the text
of the colour varies. For example, the word 'Blue' will have a text colour of red. This changes continuously,
and must achieve the highest possible score within the time limit.


INTRODUCTION
______________
This is a colour shooting game implementing a physics engine and the LibGDX library. We are using box2D and a kinematic body
to continuously update the rotation of a square and using other the features of a 'World' and 'Body' to create an
interactions between the rotating square and the bullet.

DESIGN
________

Firstly, in our views package we are using factory design pattern.
The class is created to encapsulate constructor calls to get instances of screen, ensuring
the rest of the program does not know which constructor was called.
And secondly, we have tried to implement the MVP pattern.
Following the MVP pattern, the Model package is responsible for the logic of the Colour Shooter game.
The view package is responsible for the implementation of the UI, with minimal logic being implemented.
The utils provides service for the other classes.

CONFIGURATION
_______________

It was difficult to implement different configurations for our game as rendering and implementing the physics
engine alone and using the LibGDX library for Box 2D was quite the task itself since detecting the collision
was not as simple as just as just see if the y-value of one of the components intersects
with another body. Since, the body is continuously rotating, the y-value is always varying
so using the body edge collision detections and determining the relative angle formed by the rotating
square, once the bullet is within range of the angle and also see's that the colour the bullet collided
with is the same, then it will add + 10 points and if its not correct then it will - 5 points.
However, some major changes from Phase 1 is that the
