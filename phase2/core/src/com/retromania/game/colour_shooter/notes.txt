# Step 1:

Code Affected: Within the colour_shooter package, made a states package which contains the various states of the game
such as the menu screen, pause screen, play screen (MenuScreen.java, PauseScreen.java, PlayScreen.java etc)
This is beneficial as it helps put all states of the game together to incorporate a design pattern such as the StateFactory.java
class.
