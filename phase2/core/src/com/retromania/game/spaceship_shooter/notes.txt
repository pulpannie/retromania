PHASE 2 :

# Step 1

Code affected: MenuScreen, PauseScreen, PLayScreen, Hud

Flaw: The mentioned classes should not create their buttons and labels by itself according to Single Responsibility Rule.

Fix: creation of buttons and labels are seperated from their usage by introducing ImageButtonBuilder, LabelBuilder classes (apply Builder design pattern)


#Step 2

Code affected: UfoManager

Flaw: UfoManager is currently responsibe to multiple "actors" such as: moving UFO and checking if the rocket hit UFO, drawing UFO, storing all the UFOs.

Fix: Create UfoManagerFacade that contains the same responsibilities as the UfoManager through the help of different classes: UfoDrawer, UfoMover, UfoRepo (apply facade design pattern) and having an instance variable of UfoManagerFacade in UfoManager class.


# Step 3

Code affected: UfoManager

Flaw: The mentioned class should not create its facade by itself according to Single Responsibility Rule.

Fix: creation of facade is seperated from its usage by introducing UfoManagerFacadeBuilder class(apply Builder design pattern)


#Step 4

Code affected: SpaceShipShooterStarter

Flaw: SpaceShipShooterStarter has to interact with many different subclasses of Screen. We want to obscure the creation process for those classes

Fix: Created StateFactory to encapsulate constructor call to get instance of those screens on the SpaceShipShooterStarter without it knowing which constructor was called. (apply Simple Factory Design Pattern).

#Step 5:

Code affected: Car, assets folder

Flaw: the Car that we used for the SpaceShipShooterStarter doesn't look realistic and capture the theme that we set up.

Fix: We delete our old car image, find a new car image in the form of an armoured vehicle, pushed it to our asset folder. We then set up approriate starting position and size for it to use in our game.

#Step 6:

Code affected: Car, SpaceShipShooterStarter

Flaw: the Car keep going even if it's out of the screen region.

Fix: Only allows the Car to move if it's still inside the screen region.

#Step 7: 

Code affected:

Flaw: Didn't have notes file to specify details of our changes to the SpaceShipShooter game.

Fix: Add a notes.txt file to the spaceship_shooter folder and notes the detailed changes to the game in the step-by-step format.

#Step 8:

Code affected: Asset folder, ImageButtonBuilder, Car, UFO, Rocket.

Flaw: The image that we used haven't been put to the specific folder spaceship_shooter in the assets folder.

Fix: Put the images specifically used for our game to the spaceship_shooter folder, and add their descriptions to the description.txt file inside that folder. Fix the codes to access these images in a new directory.

#Step 9:

Code affected: spaceship_shooter repository inside asset.

Flaw: The images that we used in our game hasn't been described yet.

Fix: add the descriptions of every images file to the description.txt file.

#Step 10:

Code affected: MenuScreen, PauseScreen, PlayScreen, Car.

Flaw: Inconsistent usage of Screen and RetroManiaScreen among different games.

Fix: make all the Screen classes above extends the RetroManiaScreen class, and change the implementation of method handleInput to fit with the RetroManiaScreen's structure.

#Step 11:

Code affected: MainScreenInterface

Flaw: lack of java docs and comments throughout the game.

Fix: Test adding java docs and comments to MainScreenInterface.

#Step 12:

Code affected: MainScreenInterface, UFO, UfoDrawer, UfoManager, UfoManagerFacade, UfoManagerFacadeBuilder, UfoMover, UfoRepo.

Flaw: lack of java docs and comments throughout the game.

Fix: Adding and updating java docs and comments to the above classes..

#Step 13:

Code affected: Background, Car, GameStats, Hud, ImageButtonBuilder, LabelBuilder, Rocket

Flaw: lack of java docs and comments throughout the game.

Fix: Adding and updating java docs and comments to the above classes..

#Step 14:

Code affected: MainScreenInterface, SpaceShipShooterStarter, spaceship_shooter repository inside asset.

Flaw: We haven't have the setting screen to enable/disable our theme (personal feature)

Fix: Adding a SettingScreen class that would have a select box to choose the game's theme (Independence day with UFO, Halloween with the Witch, or Christmas with Santa Clauss).

It will also have an exit button to exit to the menu screen.

#Step 15:

Code affected: UFO, MainScreenInterface, PauseScreen, PlayScreen, StateFactory, SpaceShipShooterStarter, spaceship_shooter repository inside asset.

Flaw: We haven't incorporate the setting to our game just yet.

Fix: Let the pause screen access the setting screen through touching the setting button being added to the pause screen.

Take the user input for the theme in the setting page to display the appropriate entities based on the theme on the Play Screen after exiting the setting screen to the menu screen.

#Step 16:

Code affected:  glassy-ui.json

Flaw: the template json file is not in correct java format for json files.

Fix: Fixes all the incorrect formats on that file.

#Step 17:

Code affected: SpaceShipShooterStarter, MenuScreen, SettingScreen, PauseScreen, PlayScreen

Flaw: We need to get rid of couplings and 'depreciated constructor method'

Fix: deleted "game" attribute from constructor class of all above-mentioned classes
